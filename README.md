A project to systematically ignore outliers present in the drive testing data.
The script uses different pandas techniques to isolate these outliers and categorize data into different clusters usually having 5 or more members each.
After the data cleaning, Plotly express is used to plot the data into different scatter mapbox plots to visualize the good/bad sectors to do further analysis.
